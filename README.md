# ip_addrs
A python3 library of helper fuctions for working with IPv4 addresses
This was writted by a bored and sleepy 24-year-old American in his free time. This is probably already handled somewhere in some standard library module that I don't know about. This was just a learning project. As such, it probably shouldn't be used by anyone but if you decide to, that's on you. See the part about "WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND" in [the license](/LICENSE).
